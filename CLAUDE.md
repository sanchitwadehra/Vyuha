# Project Guidelines

## Scope

- Always read `docs/scope.md` before starting any task to understand the current project scope and requirements

## External Context

- `/Users/sanchit/Documents/Context` — extra context files for building discussions
- `/Users/sanchit/Documents/screenshots` — screenshots for reference
- `docs/context.md` contains a ready summary — only read the external files above if you need deeper detail

## Git Commit Conventions

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`
  - Scope is optional but encouraged
  - Description should be concise, imperative mood, lowercase, no period at the end
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Use the body to explain *what* and *why*, not *how*
- Do **not** add a `Co-Authored-By` signature to commit messages
