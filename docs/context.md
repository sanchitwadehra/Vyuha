# Vyuha (व्यूह) — Project Context

## What is Vyuha?

An **Agentic Sandbox** inspired by Robert Axelrod's 1980s Game Theory Tournaments, built at the **Build India 2026** hackathon (Anthropic-sponsored, WeWork).

Instead of hardcoded algorithms, entities are **LLM agents** (Claude) that follow text-based rules and falter inconsistently — just like humans. A **Clash of Clans-like visual view** paired with a **chat box** gives the user "God Mode" — update rules, add resources/dangers, change the map, spawn entities, all via natural language.

## Core Tech

- **WebMCP** (Google Chrome beta, released Feb 10 2026) — chat-triggered sandbox control
- **Claude** — the brain powering each agent's reasoning
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — bridge between Claude and the game state

## The Sanskrit / Panini Vision

The long-term philosophical thesis: English ambiguity is a root cause of LLM hallucinations. Panini's Sanskrit grammar — the most detailed grammar with the least ambiguity — could serve as a "protocol layer" for reliable agentic AI. Indo-European languages translate well between each other, and Sanskrit sits at the root of that family.

## Builder — Sanchit Wadehra

- **Current role**: SDE Intern @ Scaler AI Labs (Sep 2025 – Present)
  - #1 code contributor on the AI Lab's core project
  - Built Linear MCP environment for OpenAI, Gmail MCP (79 API methods), Dreamliner RLHF platform (VNC sandbox, batch approval, RBAC), Taggr desktop app (PyQt, auto-update, telemetry)
- **Solo project**: Profit Matters — full SEBI-compliant fintech platform (MERN, Razorpay, Aadhaar e-sign, CI/CD)
- **Stack**: Python, FastAPI, TypeScript, Next.js, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, AWS, FastMCP, Playwright
- **Education**: BE CSE (AI & ML), Chandigarh University (graduating June 2026)

## Hackathon Strategy

- **BATNA**: 30 LPA offer from Colare (US firm)
- **Networking targets**: Irina Ghose (MD, Anthropic), Hemant Mohapatra (Lightspeed)
- **Approach**: Build with Anthropic's tools, flex WebMCP knowledge in conversations, pitch Sanskrit/Panini as the long-term differentiator
- **Demo flow**: Run simulation → introduce complex verbal rules via chat → show agents failing due to English ambiguity → close with the Panini thesis
